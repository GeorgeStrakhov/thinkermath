experimental math playbook for kids of all ages

## Why?
Many people are scared of math, because for them it's abstract, not intuitive and extremely disconnected from the real world.
While in reality math is all around us, we don't see it, do not appreciate it.

When studying science at school, we sometimes wonder: `Why does Nature obey the laws of math?`.
If you think about it - the question is, obviously, backwards. Nature doesn't obey the laws of math. Math is simply an abstraction of how nature tends to work. Moreover, depending on what kind of phenomenons we are looking at and at what scale, it often requires different kinds of math to properly describe the workings of Nature.
What this question reveals though - is that there is something fundamentally wrong with the way we teach math.
From early childhood we detach the world of numbers from the world of things. And as a result - we rob ourselves of the pleasure, that comes with appreciating more patterns in everything we see around. We also rob ourselves of ability to develop deeper meta-intuitions that can help us solve problems way beyond the realm that we classically regard as mathematics.

There has to be a better way of learning math.
TinkerMath is an experimental attempt to try and find it.

## What?
TinkerMath is an open-source, community-driven Experimental Math playbook for kids of all ages.
That's a lot of fancy words. Let us explain:

* _Open Source_ - Knowledge doesn't shrink when it's shared, it grows. So there is no good reason to keep it behind the closed doors.
* _Community-driven_ - Everybody thinks differently. The more active the community - the more likely we are to find people to think like us (and so can explain to us better) as well as people who think very differently and so we can rub new understandings off each other.
* _Experimental Math_ - While there is a lot of beauty in pure, conceptual, axiom-based math, it's not the only way it can be. We believe that math can also be as much an experimental science as anything else. And so the best way to learn it - is not to start with the abstract theory, but to ask real-life questions, conduct experiments, look for patterns, form hypothesis, test them... and only after that form theories. Theories that can be used later, at least until we prove them wrong.
* _Playbook_ - Learning is not about being seated and bored to death, but about being active and curious. And if learning is driven by questions coming out of individual curiosity, then the notion of universal curriculum is obsolete. Instead a Playbook approach allows you to pick and choose, move on and come back, depending on what question is itching in your head at the moment.
* _Kids of all ages_ - As long as we are curious and willing to learn by trying - we are all kids. The notion of once-and-done education is obsolete anyway in the world where live expectancy is reaching a century, while professions get obsolete in decades.

## Principles
We believe Learning Math can be best achieved if it is:

* _Experimental_ - grounded in questions about the world that may have multiple, unclear or approximate answers, not in abstract theory
* _Active_ - focused on the process, not on results
* _Embodied_ - driven by intuitive understanding about the world through physical experiences
* _Multisensory_ - experienced through seeing, touching, feeling, smelling, hearing
* _Intuitive_ - focused on developing multiple intuitions about how the world works

## How it works
TinkerMath is a playbook that consists of little experiments / activities / games, called Tinks (see below for more details and example).
Tinks are designed by the community of teachers, parents, mathemusicians and other curious characters. All Tinks are published on the wiki-like central repository: [TinkerMath](http://TinkerMath.com).

Published Tinks are tagged and categorised by the community members by difficulty, required prior knowledge (if any), required tools and approximate time. 
Everybody can then play with them, fork them, modify them, change them and explore the mathemagic in every other way.

Tinks can also be formed into curated collections, printed or published in the form of dead-tree-books etc.
Some tinks may require tools, such as Lego blocks, wooden sticks, rulers etc. Some Tinks may come with their own tools, e.g. interactive computer simulations or printable .pdf files with 'playfields' for this specific tinks.

In the future, special TinkerMath kits can be created (and sold or made DIY), that would combine all the tools required for a certain type of experiments.

## Tinks
Tinks are chunkable challenges: questions and experiments that can be carried out at home and can give you a new sense or understanding about some aspect of the world around you by allowing you to discover and play with a new pattern. 

Here is the barebones structure of a Tink:

* _Question_: what is it that we are trying to understand?
* _Experiment(s)_: how can we find it out?
* _What you need_: what are the tools required for you to carry out the experiments?
* _Discovery(ies)_: what are we likely to discover as we carry out these experiments?
* _Tinker On_: what other questions / Tinks would it be interesting to explore after this?

Best Tinks require as little of prior knowledge and tools available as possible.
A basic Tink can keep you occupied for 15 minutes or so.

## Example Tink for the very beginners
* _Question_: Is `X*Y == Y*X` true and why?
* _Experiment_: Using Lego bricks, explore multiplication as the size of area / capacity of a rectangle (i.e. the number of brick-units that can go onto a platform of certain size: e.g. only 24 brick-units can fit on a 6x4 platform.). Then try changing the orientation of a platform (i.e. a 6x4 platrorm becomes a 4x6 platform) and see if it affects the number of brick-units that can fit on it.
* _What you need_: Lego blocks and platforms
* _Discovery_: `X*Y` always equals `Y*X`, because the area of a rectangle doesn't change with it's orientation in space.
* _Tinker On_: Is the same true with `X*Y*Z` (from area to volume)? 

## Media
Math doesn't only live on paper. It lives all around us. So playing with math can and has to happen, utilizing as many media as possible. Some of them can come unexpectedly, but some can be planned and used consistently.

Here are a few starting points for the media:

* people bodies ('play the turtle', dance...)
* paper & pen
* color paper
* sticks & other wooden things
* lego blocks (NB color & third dimension!)
* music (strings, flutes, percussion to explore time)
* computer (Logo, Processing)
